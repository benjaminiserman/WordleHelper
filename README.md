## Usage

WordleHelper has four options: (letters), (words), (unique), and (play).

(letters) gives a frequency table for letters in 5-letter words. Enter a negative number to get reverse order.

(words) gives a value table for 5-letter words. The value of a 5-letter word is determined by the sum of the frequencies of its letters. Enter a negative number to get reverse order.

(unique) gives a list of 5 words that have been calculated to be the best 5 Wordle guesses to use without receiving any information about each guess.

(play) tells you words to enter. After entering a word, enter a string representing what Wordle returned about your guess. For example, if you get the following output:

you should enter "YGYWW" (case insensitive, any character other than 'Y' and 'G' represents a white tile).

Enter any number of 'g's to go back to the menu.

To change the word list, just replace words.txt with any other similarly formatted word list. WordleHelper works for any number of rounds or letters, and any language's characters.
